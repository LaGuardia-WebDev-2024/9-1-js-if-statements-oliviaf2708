## Directions

### Step #1 - Bounce off the floor! <br>

Our ball is moving down the canvas, but it keeps going down forever. Add an if statement to make it reverse direction once it gets to the bottom of the canvas. 
<br><br>

### Step #2 - Bounce off the ceiling! <br>
Okay, now let's get the ball to reverse once it hits the ceiling too, so that it keeps going down and up forever.
<br><br>

### Step #3 - Add another ball! <br>

Add a second ball to the scene that bounces off the walls as well.  

This second ball could

- move left to right OR <br>
- could move up and down at a different speed OR <br>
- could move randomly around bouncing off the walls

<em>Hint: To make the second ball move independently of the first, create new variables outside the draw function (for example, y1, speed1, x). </em>

Other possible features to try adding <br>

- when the ball bounces off a wall it could also change fill colors
- when the ball bounces off a wall the background color could change
- when the ball bounces off the wall the speed of the ball could change
